            <p>Hello! I'm a software engineer and doting cat uncle with a background in film.  Engrossing myself in such a lively, intense industry instilled the importance of having a mindset to consistently learn new skills, having effective communication, and the ability to exceed presented expectations. My ability to persist through and past obstacles stems from a child-like curiosity and love of learning about computer science and from having the mindset of software engineering being innately exhilarating.</p>
