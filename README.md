# Description

Hello, I'm a Software engineer with a background in film/cinema that instilled the importance of having a mindset to consistently learn new skills, having effective communication, and the ability to exceed presented expectations. My ability to persist through and past obstacles stems from a child-like curiosity and love of learning about computer science and from having the mindset of software engineering being innately exhilarating.

Happy hacking!

## Portfolio Description

There probably isn't a good reason to include Typescript in a portfolio website like this and if I had to redo this project, I would exclude it and use JavaScript instead.  This portfolio lists the culmination of all my work through General Assembly.  I'm very grateful that I went through this program and I cannot express my gratitude enough to all my instructors.  Thank you Esin Saribudak, Zoe Peterson, Tyler Conti, and Julio Leon.
